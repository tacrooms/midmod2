League Hub is a Prject of mine to Practice my API's, state, and React.  Redux will be added later.

The project is similar to sites like OP.GG and U.gg, where you can seach summoners for their games stats and wins and losses and also search for champs for their data.

I want to improve the CSS to a pro looking level and get redux working
